Python implementation of the DHLLDV slurry transport framework

Note that the equations are from the 3<sup>rd</sup> edition of the book '[Slurry Transport Fundamentals, A Historical Overview &  The Delft Head Loss &  Limit Deposit Velocity Framework](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330753872_The_Delft_Head_Loss_Limit_Deposit_Velocity_Framework_2nd_Edition)', By Sape A. Miedema, Edited by Robert Ramsdell

Each model has a test suite, based on 'hand' calculations contained in the included excel spreadsheet [tests/tests.xls](https://github.com/rcriii42/DHLLDV/blob/master/tests/tests.xls)

In addition, [DHLLDV Framework.xlsm](https://github.com/rcriii42/DHLLDV/blob/master/DHLLDV%20Framework.xlsm), a spreadsheet developed by Sape Miedema, implements the framework, a simple pump and slurry system model, historical models and more.
